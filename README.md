exercise 1 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/1Zd6ohQhN - Two loops were used to create an X of intersecting diagonal lines of circles, as well as giving them randomized but custom colors.
exercise 2 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/i0DHBpL3x - Uses a loop to create a 8x8 grid of circles across a 400x400 canvas, and to give them all a blue gradient.
exercise 3 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/tkhOMUxSz - A loop was used to create a grid of circles across a 400x400 canvas, and to give them all a blue gradient. If the mouse is pressed, the values of the gradient will invert, causing the circles to all have a new color.
